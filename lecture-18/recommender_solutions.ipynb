Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements.

You&#039;ve got an engineer? That&#039;s a mistake--he should never have gotten down there; send him up here.&quot;Satan says, &quot;No way.&quot; I like having an engineer on the staff, and I&#039;m keeping him.&quot;God says, &quot;Send him back up here or I&#039;ll sue.&quot;Satan laughs uproariously and answers, &quot;Yeah, right.

Carter was speaking at a business lunch in Tokyo, where he decided to open his speech with a brief joke.He told the joke, then waited for the translator to announce the Japanese version. Even though the story was quite short, Carter was surprised by how quickly the interpreter was able to re-tell it. Even more impressive was the reaction from the crowd. Carter thought the story was cute, but not outright hilarious, yet the crowd broke right up. Carter was very flattered.After the speech, Carter wanted to meet the translator to ask him how he told the joke. Perhaps there is better way to tell the joke?When Carter asked how the joke had been told in Japanese, the translator responded, &quot;I told them, &#039;President Carter has told a very funny joke. Please laugh now.&#039;&quot;\r\n",
