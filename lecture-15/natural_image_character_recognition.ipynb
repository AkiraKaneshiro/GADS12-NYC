      "# Classifying Characters in Natural Images with Support Vector Machines\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lab we will classify alphanumeric characters in photographs. The Chars74K data set, collected by T. E. de Campos, B. R. Babu and M. Varma for \u201cCharacter Recognition in Natural Images\u201d, contains more than 74,000 images of the digits zero through nine and the characters for both cases of the English alphabet. The following are three examples of images of the lowercase letter \u201cz\u201d. Chars74K can be downloaded from http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/.  \n",

      "![files/img/8365OS_09_33.png](files/img/8365OS_09_33.png)  \n",
      "\n",
      "Several types of images comprise the collection. We will use 7,705 images of characters that were extracted from photographs of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India. In contrast to MNIST, the images in this portion of Chars74K depict the characters in a variety of fonts, colors, and perturbations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First we load the images for each of the sixty-two classes and convert them to greyscale using mahotas. As with previous examples, we wrap the script in a main block to support forking additional processes during grid search. Unlike MNIST, the images of Chars74K do not have consistent dimensions, so we will resize them to thirty pixels on a side."
